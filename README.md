Book Listing App (Project 7) for "Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program" - (EU Scholarship) by Udacity

## Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making an app that lists books.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. You will be using the google books api in order to fetch results and display them to the user.

## What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Fetching data from an API
* Using an AsyncTask
* Parsing a JSON response
* Creating a list based on that data and displaying it to the user.
